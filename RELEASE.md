# Release Process

This repo releases by pushing a `v*` tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml` does the rest:
quality gate → PyPI (OIDC) → Docker (GHCR + Docker Hub) → Homebrew formula bump → GitHub Release.

## Prerequisites

- All work lands on `main` via a squash-merged PR (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process)).
- `gh` CLI authenticated with repo write access.
- Local `main` up to date: `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`.

## Steps

1. **Bump the version** in `pyproject.toml` (`version = "X.Y.Z"`), commit on the feature/release branch
   (not directly on `main`), push, and let CI go green on the PR.
   ```bash
   git commit -am "chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```
2. **Squash-merge the PR.**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch=false
   ```
   `--delete-branch=false` is deliberate — this repo doesn't auto-delete release branches (see
   `release/v1.17.0`, `discoverability-dx` still on the remote after their releases). Delete manually
   later if you want the cleanup; don't make it part of the release itself.
3. **Sync local `main`.**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
   ```
4. **Tag and push** — this is what triggers `release.yml`.
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — <one-line summary>"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
5. **Watch the workflow to completion** — don't consider the release done until every job is green.
   ```bash
   gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId') --exit-status
   ```
6. **Write real release notes.** The workflow's auto-generated body is a flat `git log --no-merges`
   dump since the last tag — accurate but not useful to a reader. Replace it with a structured,
   per-feature summary (what shipped, why, quality signal), keeping the Install/Docker/Full-Changelog
   footer the workflow already generated:
   ```bash
   gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file /tmp/notes.md
   ```
7. **Re-sync local `main` again.** The release workflow's `update-formula` job pushes a
   "Update Homebrew formula to X.Y.Z" commit back to `main` *after* your tag push — a pull done in
   step 3 will be one commit stale once the workflow finishes.
   ```bash
   git pull --ff-only
   ```
8. **Verify the artifacts actually landed** — the workflow going green means the push commands ran;
   confirm the registries themselves updated (PyPI can lag a few seconds, Docker Hub's REST API can
   lag longer than the push itself):
   ```bash
   curl -sf "https://pypi.org/pypi/dd-agents/X.Y.Z/json" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['info']['version'])"
   docker manifest inspect zoharbabin/due-diligence-agents:X.Y.Z >/dev/null && echo OK
   ```

## Closing issues

**Don't rely on a squash-merge PR body's `Closes #A, #B, #C` to auto-close every listed issue.**
GitHub only parses closing keywords from a squash commit if they survive into the squash commit
message *as GitHub builds it* (the individual commit messages, not the PR description) — a PR body
listing five issues auto-closed only one of them in practice. After merging, check what actually
closed and close the rest explicitly:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query { repository(owner: "zoharbabin", name: "due-diligence-agents") {
    pullRequest(number: N) { closingIssuesReferences(first: 10) { nodes { number } } }
  } }' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.closingIssuesReferences.nodes'

# for anything not in that list:
gh issue close <N> --comment "Resolved by #<PR>, merged into \`main\` at <sha> and released as vX.Y.Z."
```

If the PR closes every open issue in a milestone, close the milestone too — there's no `gh milestone`
subcommand, so use the REST API directly:

```bash
gh api repos/zoharbabin/due-diligence-agents/milestones/<N> -X PATCH -f state=closed
```

## What NOT to do

- Don't bump the version or tag directly on `main` before the PR merges — the bump commit belongs
  in the PR so CI validates it together with the code change.
- Don't tag before the PR's CI is green — the release workflow re-runs the full quality gate anyway,
  but a red PR means you're about to publish something you haven't actually verified.
- Don't hand-write PyPI/Docker/Homebrew publishing steps — they're automated in `release.yml`;
  manual publishing risks drifting from what CI already builds and tests.
- Don't leave the auto-generated release notes as-is for a release with more than a couple of
  commits — a flat commit list doesn't tell a user what changed or why.
